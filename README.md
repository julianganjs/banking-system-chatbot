# Chatbot for Banking Systems
This repository contains the source code for a banking system chatbot named Bonk. Bonk automates various tasks relevant to fixed deposit (FD) investments. It can also calculate the principal, interest rate, compound ratio, number of years and balance based on the values given to it. It can also generate a report for a desired year interval, which can be saved into a file. The application is developed using C programming language.
## Packages
- stdio.h
- math.h
- string.h
- stdlib.h
> These packages are already included in the C standard library. Hence, no external dependencies are needed, only an IDE for C.
## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run main.c.
## Code Description
1. Menu: An interface is generated where the user can choose from 7 different options.
2. Value Calculation: The values for principal, interest rate, compound ratio, number of years and balance can be calculated individually by providing the others.
3. Report Generation: A report can be generated for given year interval.
4. Account Comparison: An algorithm calculates the number years needed for two accounts with different compound ratios to have the same balance.
5. Chatbot: An algorithm that reads the text from keyboard or file inputs, and processes the inputs to determine the type of operations required to be performed.
