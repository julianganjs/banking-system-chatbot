# Chatbot for Banking Systems
This repository contains the source code for a banking system chatbot named Bonk. Bonk automates various tasks relevant to fixed deposit (FD) investments. The application is developed using C programming language.
## Packages
- stdio.h
- math.h
- string.h
- stdlib.h
> These packages are already included in the C standard library. Hence, there are no external dependencies. Only an IDE for C programming is needed, like Microsoft Visual Studio.
## Code Description
- Menu: An interface is generated where the user can choose from 8 different functions.
- Value Calculation: The principal, interest rate, compound ratio, number of years and balance can be calculated individually by providing the values of other fields.
- Report Generation: A report can be generated for a given year interval.
- Account Comparison: An algorithm that calculates the number years needed for two accounts with different compound ratios to have the same balance.
- Chatbot: An algorithm that reads the text from keyboard or file inputs, and processes them to determine the type of operations required to be performed.
